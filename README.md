DINO Paper Reconstruction with ResNet-50 and ImageNet
Project Overview
This project aims to reproduce the key findings of the paper "Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers,"

Project Roadmap
Phase 1: Environment Setup & Literature Review (July 8 - July 9)

Task 1.1: Set up the development environment with Python, PyTorch, and other necessary libraries (e.g., torchvision, tqdm).

Task 1.2: Thoroughly re-read the DINO paper, focusing on the self-distillation loss, multi-crop augmentation, and the student-teacher architecture.

Task 1.3: Review literature on applying self-supervised learning to ResNet architectures.

Phase 2: Data Preparation & Augmentation (July 10 - July 11)
Task 2.1: Download and prepare the ImageNet dataset.

Task 2.2: Implement the multi-crop augmentation strategy as described in the DINO paper. This involves creating two global views and several smaller local views.

Phase 3: Model Implementation (July 14 - July 16)
Task 3.1: Implement the student and teacher ResNet-50 models.

Task 3.2: Implement the DINO head (a projection head) for both models.

Task 3.3: Implement the momentum update mechanism for the teacher network's weights.

Phase 4: Training Pipeline (July 17 - July 21)
Task 4.1: Implement the DINO loss function (cross-entropy on student/teacher outputs).

Task 4.2: Build the main training script, integrating the models, data loaders, loss function, and optimizer.

Task 4.3: Begin the training process on a subset of ImageNet to debug and validate the pipeline.

Task 4.4: Launch the full training run on ImageNet.

Phase 5: Evaluation & Analysis (July 22)
Task 5.1: Implement evaluation protocols, specifically k-NN evaluation on the frozen features.

Task 5.2: Run the evaluation script on the trained ResNet-50 model.

Task 5.3: Analyze the results. Do the features show properties like semantic segmentation?

Phase 6: Documentation & Finalization (July 23 - July 24)
Task 6.1: Document the project, including the architecture, training process, and results.

Task 6.2: Clean up the code and add comprehensive comments.

Task 6.3: Finalize the README.md with a summary of findings and instructions to reproduce the experiment.

Task 6.4: Prepare a final presentation or report of the project outcomes.
